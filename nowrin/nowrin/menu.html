              <p>A flat white is a blend of micro-foamed milk poured over a single or double shot of espresso.
                 This microfoam is steamed milk infused with air, to create a smooth and velvety texture and creamy taste.</p>

              <p>In Italian, the term "macchiato" translates as "marked" or "stained", meaning a stained or marked coffee. 
                The macchiato is an espresso coffee drink, topped with a small amount of foamed or steamed milk .</p>

                </div>
              <p>iAlthough a mocha is often interpreted differently across the world, the basis is that a shot of espresso is
                 combined with a chocolate powder or syrup, followed by milk or cream. It is a variant of a latte, in the sense
                  that it is often 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk. However, a chocolate flavour is added, and this can be milk or dark.</p>

                </div>
              <p>Due to the fact it’s a coffee concentrate, many think that cold brew has more caffeine content than the average cup.
                 However, the reality is that because you dilute this concentrate, the caffeine level drops.</p>

                    <h5 class ="price">$25</h5>

                </div>
              <p>Unlike other coffee types the milk isn’t texturised and instead, Cortado coffee is made with lightly steamed milk,
                 no froth or foam. The steamed milk on top reduces the acidity of the coffee and creates a micro-foam which doesn’t 
                 separate from the espresso, giving it a strong and rich flavour.</p>
